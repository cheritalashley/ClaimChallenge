// 1-check to see if number is odd or even

// 2-check to see if that variable is divisible by 3, 5, or both.

/* 3-output a new string where every number is changed into its written form (e.g. "3" becomes "three"),
  
unless the result is that the number evaluated is indivisible by 3 or 5, 
  
in which case, change the output string to 
  "Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All"*/
